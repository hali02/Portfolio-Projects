# Portfolio-Projects

I am an aspiring data analyst looking to break into a corporate role as a data or business analyst. I hope to showcase some of my data analysis skills through my portfolio projects. My capstone project would be the first project on this repository, titled 'An Analysis of Daily Sales for a Convenience Store Business.' I use my Python skills to analyze the different variables that impact the sales of a convenience store. Other skills used in this project include web scraping and regression analysis.

Other projects in this respository include interacting with a stock API and an exploratory analysis of video game sales using SQL. To view other examples of my skills with SQL, please view my 'sqlpracticeproblems' repository where I've saved my solutions to some practice interview SQL questions of varying difficulty.

Overall, I am proficient in using Python for data analysis, SQL (including joins, partitions, aggregrate functions, CTEs, etc) and Tableau for visualization.
